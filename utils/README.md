# Several utils for development

- `simple_gen.py` generates a random graph in either Rust-Structure or XML-TSPLIB structure
- `benchmark_gen.py` generates a range of principal minors of the same graph for asymptotic growth benchmark
- `NN_approx.py` traces out a Nearest Neighbour for helping to create manual test cases
