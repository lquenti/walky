# Exact single node benchmarks

# how to
0. Compile (see root benchmark folder) and generate data (see `run.sh` where it will be loaded from)
1. find out the maximum amount (given 5min max time) using `find_maximum.sh` (read the script)
2. Write the results into `run.sh`
3. Run `run.sh`
4. Visualize using `plot_results.py`

btw since the data is so small we just test e2e with loading, but again the overhead should be neligable
